# iCors

This is a javascript method with no AJAX or Proxy Domain or JSONP to share cookie between different domains.

aa_domain and bb_domain - clients domain no matter who they are
cc_domain - cental domain where the cookie will be stored


# Knowing Issues

The COOKIE.set method is not implemented with duration option

There is not a delete method implemented yet

There is not a has method implemented yet

The code is not optimized!

Anyway, enjoy!

;)
