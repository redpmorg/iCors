# iCors

This is a javascript method with no AJAX or Proxy Domain or JSONP to share cookie between different domains.

aa_domain and bb_domain - clients domain no matter who they are

cc_domain - central domain where the cookie will be stored

The library is deliberate not optimized and minified because this should be use as teaching material!

# Example

aa_domain, bb_domain and cc_domain should be configured as valid domains.

Open first browser tab or window and enter http://aa

Hit "Like" button

Open second browser tab and enter http://bb!
